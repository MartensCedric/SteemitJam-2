Theme : Into the unknown 

Meaning of 'unknown' : 
- Exploration of something
- Something not widely known

Things that are unknown : 
- Space
- Abyss
- Ocean depths
- The New World (Americas)
- Lost Jungle
- Darkness
- Egyptian Pyramid
- Cave exploration
- An anonymous person
- Game mechanics could be unknown?

"Into" seems to emphasize on "diving" into a wild exploration

Darkness can be avoided by raising gamma ...

Unknown now :
- Space 
- Abyss
- Ocean depths

Unknown in the past :
- The New World (Americas)
- The Solar System


# Idea 1 - "Into the New World"
I like the "New World" type of unknown : now what to do?

People that discovered the New World :
- Vikings
- Europeans
- Bering Strait immigrants

New World Colonial game?

"Into the New World"
- Boats
- Managing supplies?
- Fighting against pirates?

What is the objective?

Management game loses the "exploration" aspect, same goes with boat fighting style...

How can exploration be effectively part of a game jam...?
Procedural generation...?

Can be done with a hex map

Procedural generation on islands is way to hard for a game jam, it will kill the time necessary to implement a main mechanic

# Idea 2 - 
Exploring an ancient Egypt pyramid 
Usually games revolving with this setting are infinite runners, but I don't want to do that.
Something like MYST is way too complicated...for a jam

# Idea 3 
Cave game where you learn the map with exploration, on death the map does not disappear.
Or instead, you could see your corpse and try to memorize what paths you took... Maybe you can place
torches so you remember where you went last...

# Idea 4
Boat in a deep sea with a lot of fog where you defend against sea monsters and manage your crew.

You will need to avoid rocks and lookout for monsters in a macromanagement style while micromanaging your men.

Tasks that your men can accomplish :
- Move around the boat
- Carry ammunition
- Load cannon
- Aim cannon
- Fire
- Take up the steering wheel

Men can die (Effectively making the game harder)


You can only see far from your boat when one of your men is in a lookout position.
Crew members can have sea sickeness which makes the slower/less effective. The captain has better stats than other
men.
