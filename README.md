Since ye're a Corsair ye already be knowin' how t' load a cannon, but just in case ye forgot, I will be tellin' ye how. Load a cannon by **bringin' ammo t' th' cannon**, then ye need t' **get a rammer** and push down th' ammo. ye should then **put th' rammer back whar ye took it** t' keep thin's nice and tidy on th' deck. Now hold tight and get ready fer a blast. If ye have good aim ye should hear th' agonizin' scream o' a sea monster, by Blackbeard's sword!

Firin' a cannon may be a blast hehe, but ye should keep an eye on th' lookout fer potential dangers, I'll warrant ye! If ye think thin's be in a terrible condition, use th' wheel without th' Cap'n's permission, as long as th' ship be safe, he won't mind.
